# tab-closer-ff
A fast batch tab closer for Firefox - Webextension

This extension allows you to close multiple tabs at once - very useful when you happen to be unorganized and to open hundreds of tabs.

This extension does not load icons, as they make the extension slow when going over ~100 tabs. This way, the extension can display easily over 500-600 tabs in the list, almost instantly. 

It integrates rather well with the Firefox theme, using Firefox's builtin stylesheets.
